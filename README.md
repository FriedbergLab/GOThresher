# GOThresher: a program to remove annotation biases from protein function annotation datasets

GOThresher removes annotation bias from [GAF](http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-formats) files based on annotation information content, GO evidence, annotation source, number of proteins annotated from a given source, and date.  GOThresher accepts one or more GAF files as input. The motivation for GOThresher lies in the observation that protein function annotations are biased due to high throughput experimental studies ([1](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003063)). Removing such annotation biases can help present a more balanced picture of protein annotations for a given organism or set of proteins.  

-------------

## Prerequisites

### Required modules:

GOThresher requires Python 3.5 or newer with the following libraries installed:
* [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Biopython](http://biopython.org/)
* [xlsxwriter](http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/)

Modules can be automatically installed using `pip`, or obtained from their respective websites.

If GOthresher is installed using conda, none of the above pre-requisites are needed.

### Required files:

GOThresher requires an obo formatted version of the Gene Ontology. Depending on your needs, this would usually be one of [go-basic.obo](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/go-basic.obo) or [go.obo](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.obo). For more details and to download either the most recent daily version or the latest version go to the [Gene Ontology website](http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology). 

Additionally, a config file that defines parameters to generate mapping files is required. This will be a `.ini` file, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher/blob/master/gothresher.ini). If user clones this repository in the following installation step, the `.ini` and `ExampleData/go.obo` files will be included.

-------------

## Installation

GOThresher is available on PyPi, so the recommended way to install GOThresher is through `pip`. Do note, this approach will not download any data and config files that are available on GitHub. User will have to clone the repository separately to download example data and files required to run GOThresher. 

You can install GOThresher by running:
```
$ pip install gothresher
```
<!--
OR
```
$ pip install git+git://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher
```
-->

GOThresher can be installed using conda. Please note, user will have to download config and `.obo` files required to run GOThresher separately from the GitHub.  

You can install GOThresher by running
```
$ conda install -c bioconda gothresher
```

It is recommended to create an isolated conda environment and install GOThresher into it. This allows having the correct version of all the dependencies isolated from the system's Python installation.
```
$ conda create --name gth -c bioconda python=3.7 gothresher
```

Before using GOThresher, you should activate the environment:
```
$ conda activate gth
```

Alternatively, it is possible to **manually download** from GitHub or **clone the repository** using the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher
$ cd GOThresher
```
and install GOThresher by running: 
```
$ pip install .
```

After installation, follow the steps described below for detailed instructions about how to use GOThresher. Alternatively, you can jump to [example usage](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher/blob/master/README.md#example-usage)

-------------

## Generate initial mapping files

GOThresher requires graphs of the three ontologies (MF, CC, BP), mapping of GO terms to all of its ancestors, and mapping of alternate GO IDs to actual GO IDs. These files can be generated by running `gothresher_prep`.

**Run this command only once to generate the mapping files**

```
$ gothresher_prep -c <CONFIGFILE> -i <GOFILE>
```

### Config file:
`<CONFIGFILE>` will be a `.ini.` file that defines parameters to generate mapping files.
- `onto_dir`: Name of output directory where the mapping files will be saved. Default is set to `onto` but can be changed as per user preferences.
- `root_bpo`: GO ID for the root term of BPO graph
- `root_cco`: GO ID for the root term of CCO graph
- `root_mfo`: GO ID for the root term of MFO graph

### Ontology:
`<GOFILE>` will usually be one of `go.obo` or `go-basic.obo`.

`gothresher_prep` will generate seven files in total:
1. Three files corresponds to the three ontologies
2. Three files corresponds to the mapping between each GO_term and its ancestors in its own respective ontology
3. One file containing mapping from alternate GO_ID to actual GO_ID. 
 
IMPORTANT: This command needs to be run again when a new version of ontology is available and updated graphs/mapping files need to be used for analysis. In that case, please use `gothresher_prep` after downloading a new go.obo file.

Following files will be generated within the user specified `<onto_dir>` folder:

```
1. ./<onto_dir>/alt_to_id.graph : Needed to obtain mapping from alternate GO_ID to actual GO_ID
2. ./<onto_dir>/mf.graph : The MFO Ontology graph
3. ./<onto_dir>/bp.graph : The BPO Ontology graph
4. ./<onto_dir>/cc.graph : The CCO Ontology graph
5. ./<onto_dir>/mf_ancestors.map : The MFO Ancestors map
6. ./<onto_dir>/bp_ancestors.map : The BPO Ancestors map
7. ./<onto_dir>/cc_ancestors.map : The CCO Ancestors map
```

-------------

## Quick setup

1. Download the latest `go.obo` or `go-basic.obo` file from http://www.geneontology.org/ontology/ 

2. Run the program `gothresher_prep` program and provide the downloaded `obo` file as well as the config file included in this repository. See the usage details [here](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher#generate-initial-mapping-files). This program needs to be run only when a new `obo` file needs to be used.

3. Run the program `gothresher`

                        of the Information Accretion for every GO term.
                        Calculation of the information accretion is time
                        consuming. Therefore keep it to zero if you are
                        performing rerun on old data. The program will then
                        read the information accretion values from a file
                        which it wrote to in the previous run of the program
  --info_threshold_Wyatt_Clark_percentile INFO_THRESHOLD_WYATT_CLARK_PERCENTILE, -WCTHRESHp INFO_THRESHOLD_WYATT_CLARK_PERCENTILE
                        Provide the percentile p. All annotations having
                        information content below p will be discarded
  --info_threshold_Wyatt_Clark INFO_THRESHOLD_WYATT_CLARK, -WCTHRESH INFO_THRESHOLD_WYATT_CLARK
                        Provide a threshold value t. All annotations having

  --info_threshold_Phillip_Lord_percentile INFO_THRESHOLD_PHILLIP_LORD_PERCENTILE, -PLTHRESHp INFO_THRESHOLD_PHILLIP_LORD_PERCENTILE
                        Provide the percentile p. All annotations having
                        information content below p will be discarded. So if 5 is provided, proteins annotated by 
                        terms whose score is in the bottom 5% will be discarded.
  --info_threshold_Phillip_Lord INFO_THRESHOLD_PHILLIP_LORD, -PLTHRESH INFO_THRESHOLD_PHILLIP_LORD
                        Provide a  value t. All annotations having
                        information content below t will be discarded
  --verbose VERBOSE, -v VERBOSE
                        Set this argument to 1 if you wish to view the outcome
                        of each operation on the console
  --date_before DATE_BEFORE, -dbfr DATE_BEFORE
                        The date entered here will be parsed by the parser
                        from dateutil package. For more information on
                        acceptable date formats please visit
                        https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/. All annotations
                        made prior to this date will be selected
  --date_after DATE_AFTER, -daftr DATE_AFTER
                        The date entered here will be parsed by the parser
                        from dateutil package. For more information on
                        acceptable date formats please visit
                        https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/. All annotations
                        made after this date will be selected
  --single_file SINGLE_FILE, -single SINGLE_FILE
                        Set to 1 in order to output the results of all provided inputs into a single output file.
  --select_references SELECT_REFERENCES [SELECT_REFERENCES ...], -selref SELECT_REFERENCES [SELECT_REFERENCES ...]
                        Provide the paths to files which contain references
                        you wish to select. It is possible to include
                        references in case you wish to select annotations made
                        by a few references. This will prompt the program to
                        interpret string which have the keywords
                        'GO_REF','PMID' and 'Reactome' as a GO reference.
                        Strings which do not contain that keyword will be
                        interpreted as a file path which the program will
                        except to contain a list of GO references. The program
                        will accept a mixture of GO_REF and file names. It is
                        also possible to choose all references of a particular
                        category and a handful of references from another. For
                        example if you wish to choose all PMID references,
                        just put PMID. The program will then select all PMID
                        references. Currently the program can accept PMID,
                        GO_REF and Reactome
  --select_references_inverse SELECT_REFERENCES_INVERSE [SELECT_REFERENCES_INVERSE ...], -selrefinv SELECT_REFERENCES_INVERSE [SELECT_REFERENCES_INVERSE ...]
                        Works like -selref but does not select the references
                        which have been provided as input
  --report REPORT, -r REPORT
                        Provide the path where the report file will be stored.
                        If you are providing a path please make sure your path
                        ends with a '/'. Otherwise the program will assume the
                        last string after the final '/' as the name of the
                        report file. A single report file will be generated.
                        Information for each species will be put into
                        individual worksheets.
  
Required arguments:
  --input INPUT [INPUT ...], -i INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        The input file path. Please remember the name of the
                        file must start with goa in front of it, with the name
                        of the species following separated by an underscore
```

NOTE: Files inside the folder `temp` are generated when `-recal` is set to 1.

-------------

## Example usage

### Step 1: Generating graphs and mapping files

```$ gothresher_prep -i ExampleData/go.obo -c gothresher.ini```

This command will generate seven files in total. Three files corresponding
to the three ontologies, and three files corresponding to the mapping between
each GO Term and its ancestors in its own respective ontology. The last
file contains mapping from alternate GO_ID to actual GO_ID. Please use
this command every time you update GOFILE. 

### Step 2: Running GOThresher

1. ```$ gothresher -cprot 100 -i ExampleData/goa_exampleYeast.gaf ExampleData/goa_exampleDicty.gaf -a C -WCTHRESHp 2 -recal 1```

This command reads two input files - one for yeast and the other for
dicty. The `-a C` selects the annotations which are only "CCO". 
The `-WCTHRESHp` argument specifies that the Wyatt Clark Threshold is 2
percent, which means all annotations having a Wyatt Clark Information
content below 2% will be removed. Instead of providing a percentage
value, user can also provide a threshold value using the argument
`-WCTHRESH`. In addition to that, those annotations will be removed which
have been annotated by references that have annotated more than
100 proteins in a single paper. The output will be saved in the current directory. It is
necessary to have `-recal 1` in this command since the GO Term to IC mapping has not been created yet. Subsequent runs for the same data with different threshold values is possible without providing the argument `-recal`, however for new data files, use `-recal 1`.
This command will generate 3 output files - one file each for the two organisms,
and the third one is a file where annotations for both the organisms are combined into a single file. 

2. ```$ gothresher -i ExampleData/goa_exampleYeast.gaf ExampleData/goa_exampleDicty.gaf -a C P -PLTHRESHp 30 -e EXPEC IBA -odir ExampleData/output -single 1```

This command will reads two input files, select "CCO" and "BPO"
annotations. Further, it will choose only those annotations which
have been made experimentally "EXPEC" or have been annotated computationally as
"IBA" (Inferred from Biological aspect of Ancestor). In addition to that
it will discard all annotations which have a Phillip Lord information
content less than 30%. Instead of providing a percentage value user can
also provide a threshold value using the argument `-PLTHRESH`. The final
output will be generated inside the `ExampleData/output` directory. User can include non
existent paths. The program will attempt to create the folders if
required permissions are present. This will lead to only one output file, since
the `-single 1` argument has been provided, which will contain all the
selected annotations from both the organisms. 

3. ```$ gothresher -cattn 1000 -i ExampleData/goa_exampleYeast.gaf ExampleData/goa_exampleDicty.gaf -a C P -einv COMPEC -pref testing -selrefinv Reactome```

This command will read two input files, select "CCO" and "BPO"
annotations. Further, it will discard those annotations which have
been made computationally. The program further filters out all
annotations made by "Reactome". All files will be prefixed with the
string "testing". Since the program creates a meaningful name for each
file, the user has been given the opportunity to give a prefix.

## Unit testing

Unit tests are provided inside the directory `tests`. Please note, if GOThresher has been directly installed from PyPi using `pip`, or using `conda`, user will have to download relevant files to run the test script separately.

### Prerequisites

#### Required module to run the test script:

* [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

`unittest` has been built into the Python standard library, and therefore comes packaged with Python.

#### Required files:

Download the entire GOThresher repository (Recommended):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher
$ cd GOThresher/tests
```
OR 

Download the tests directory only: 
```
$ svn export https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher.git/trunk/tests
$ cd tests
```

**Run the tests from within the `tests` directory:**

```
$ python test_gothresher.py
```

Expected output:
```
OK
```
